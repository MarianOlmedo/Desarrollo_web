<p class="normal centrar">
  <span class="textoGrande">Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply <span class="negrita comicSans">dummy
    text of the printing and typesetting industry.</span> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
    standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of
    type and scrambled it to make a <span class="textoRelativo">type specimen book</span>. It has survived not only five centuries,
     but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was
     popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
      and more recently with <span class="italica capitalizar">desktop publishing software </span>
      like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
